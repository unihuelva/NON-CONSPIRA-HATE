## INTRODUCTION

The project **CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND HATE SPEECH ONLINE: COMPARISON OF PATTERNS IN NARRATIVES AND SOCIAL NETWORKS ABOUT COVID-19, IMMIGRANTS, REFUGEES AND LGBTI PEOPLE [NON-CONSPIRAHATE! - Reference number: PID2021-123983OB-I00]** has been funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, the Agencia Estatal de Investigación [DOI: 10.13039/501100011033], and con-funded by FEDER/UE under the Call "Proyectos de Generación de Conocimiento 2021” [Knowledge Generation Projects]. The project has a duration of four years (from September 1, 2022, to August 31, 2026). 

With the support of Big Data strategies, social network analysis, and quantitative and qualitative analysis (mixed methods), the project will develop tools for collecting and comparatively analyzing different datasets related to COVID-19, immigrants, and refugees, and LGBTI individuals. 

These objectives are crucial because disinformation about the pandemic, as well as racist, xenophobic, and other intolerant expressions, are frequently disseminated on social media platforms. While conspiracy theories are not new in human history, they have proliferated significantly in recent years, amplified by platforms like Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, and others. International and European institutions have raised alarms about the increased expressions of hate and intolerance toward various minorities during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Asian populations, refugees, immigrants, Roma people, women, Jews, and LGBTI individuals were targeted with hate speech, sometimes unfairly blaming them for the pandemic. Hate rhetoric on social media and occasional incidents of violence or hate crimes in everyday life exacerbate the vulnerability and denial of rights for these minorities due to racism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and transphobia. 

In this context, and due to the large amount of information that flows through networks, it is key to have techniques and tools based on artificial intelligence capable of efficiently discovering expressions of hate and intolerance and false information intended to generate rejection towards the main vulnerable groups. Currently, it is one of the most important challenges in Computer Science and Natural Language Processing. The automatic discovery of this information among a mountain of existing data will allow professionals in the Social, Human and Health Sciences to optimize their research and refine their prevention and social intervention.

This project includes beneficial activities to prevent and combat conspiracy theories and online hate speech in society. It will create and develop new scientific-technological knowledge and make the resulting tools and knowledge open to stakeholders and citizens through a website (dashboard), an online course and various scientific and technical publications. The Project will disseminate the results among the local, national, and international public (Open Science) and will design a knowledge transfer and sustainability plan for greater social impact.

## OBJECTIVES 

1. Identify and mapping narratives of hate speech online towards refugees, immigrants and LGBTI people (as vulnerable groups), linked to COVID-19 denialist and anti-vaccination conspiracy theories.
2. Comparing patterns of communication in social media (rhetoric, language, micro discourses, semantic networks, emotions, etc.) deployed in different datasets: COVID-19, immigration, and refugees and LGBTI people).
3. Map of actors and networks found in datasets under comparison, trying to understand patterns and strategies deployed by extremist groups that fuel hatred and the connections between online hatred and hate crimes in daily life through case studies and fake histories. The project looks for common actors or communities through different datasets.
4. Developing new strategies, based on artificial intelligence, to identify, analyse, prevent, and counteract conspiracy theories and hate speech online on social media platforms.
5. Create and develop formation, training, and awareness-raising initiatives for stakeholders.
6. Generate technical tools and knowledge accessible (Open access) to stakeholders, policymakers, firms, activists, and citizens as tools to aid the legal struggle against conspiracy theories and online hate speech being disseminated through the Web. 
7. Engagement, Communication, Dissemination and Transfer/Sustainability.

## HYPOTHESIS AND NOVELTY

Some recent observations and research identify common patterns, parallelisms, and social connections among those who promote hatred towards vulnerable groups and some expressions of denialist and anti-vaccination new movements. Nevertheless, little is still systematically known about common communication and relation patterns and the existence of common strategies and actors that promote denialist and anti-vaccination conspiracy theories and hate narratives towards immigrants and refugees and LGBTI people.  

Given this scenario, this project principally aims to automatically detect and mapping narratives of hate speech online towards refugees, immigrants and LGBTI people (as vulnerable groups), linked to COVID-19 denialist and anti-vaccination conspiracy theories. It aims to compare patterns of communication on social media, social networks, and strategies deployed by extremist groups that fuel hatred under the hypothesis that several times conspiracy theories and hate speech online have common roots. With the support of Big Data strategies, social network analysis, and quantitative and qualitative analysis (with a mixed-methods approach), it will develop tools for collecting and making comparative analysis of different datasets (COVID-19, immigrants, and refugees, LGBTI people). 


## RELEVANCE

The project is aligned with the current policies of the European Union and Spain, aiming to contribute to the objectives set by the State Scientific, Technical and Innovation Research Plan (PEICTI) [Plan Estatal de Investigación Científica, Técnica y de Innovación 2021-2023, Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (2021)] and the 2025 Digital Spain Plan Plan España Digital 2025, Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos y Transformación Digital (2021)] which intend that digital transformation both help to achieve sustainable economic and social growth, and that through artificial intelligence, promoting the intensive use of data, a contribution is made to current social challenges (for instance, gender inequality, respect for fundamental rights, non-discrimination based on gender). One of the main contributions of this project to those crucial goals is to be achieved by the interdisciplinary work of experts in the areas of Social Sciences, Computing and Health.

## RESEARCH TEAM

The NON-CONSPIRA-HATE! project involves researchers from various countries and universities, with extensive experience across four countries (Spain, Italy, Portugal, and Argentine). This project is developed by an interdisciplinary team of senior researchers, as well as predoctoral researchers developing their PhD and Master students.

The project involves researchers from the areas of Sociology, Social Psychology and Health, under the direction of Estrella Gualda, belonging to the Center for Research in Contemporary Thought and Innovation for Social Development (COIDESO, https://uhu.es/coideso), the research group Social Studies and Social Intervention (ESEIS, https://eseis.es/). Also, researchers from the area of Computer Languages and Systems, led by Jacinto Mata, as well as other researchers of the research group “Information and Knowledge Engineering” (I2C, https://citesuhu.com/tic-243/), and the Technology, Energy and Sustainability Research Center (CITES, https://citesuhu.com/) compose the interdisciplinary  team at the University of Huelva. 

Together with researchers from the University of Huelva, the team is made up of a group of researchers from the areas of Social Sciences, Humanities and Techniques from the Universities of Malaga and the Autonomous University in Madrid (Spain), the international group Narratives & Social Changes – International Research Group at the University of Salerno (Italy), the Research Center for Tourism, Sustainability and Well-being (CinTurs, University of the Algarve, Portugal). In Latin America, researchers belonging to the Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences (INHUS), a unit dependent on the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research (CONICET) and the National University of Mar del Plata (UNMdP) in Argentina are members of the international team.
